# Demographic Trends & Building Geometry In the District of Columbia (DC)

This article was originally written by me and a classmate for a Data Analytics graduate course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The paper was selected as among the best in the class and was subsequently posted on the Industrial Engineering ERA platform.

The analysis leverages a massive Microsoft dataset [https://github.com/microsoft/USBuildingFootprints] with shapefiles for nearly every structure in the United States along with demographic, cultural and economic population data for Washington DC from Urban- Greater DC [https://greaterdc.urban.org/data-explorer?geography=cl17&topic=education].

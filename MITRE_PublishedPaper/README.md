I  was the lead author on this paper that was submitted and published by IEEE as part of the 2019 Integrated Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance Conference. The paper was awarded second place in its track. 

The paper is an analysis effort to estimate the financial and fuel-burn benefits associated with large scale airspace and procedural redesigns along the US east coast. The analysis leverages a hybridization of a multi-stage regression model with a fast-time model.
